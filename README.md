## Process ##

1. I created a public repository online through GitHub
2. I edited the ReadME file using the web-browser method to include a basic introduction and a link to the homework instructions 
3. Then I started a new project in RStudio and used the web URL to Connect RStudio to git and GitHub
4. I then edited the ReadME file locally using the pull, edit locally, save, commit, push to github.com workflow
5. I used stack overflow (an online CS forum) and documentation on the STAT 545 for syntax references 
6. Using these references I was able to play around with pictures, lists, headers, links etc...
7. I then created a new R Markdown file in which I played around with the gapminder data
8. From this point I ran through portions of the gapminder excercise from September 14
9. I also added some headers to the gapminder.Rmd to denote each function
8. To produce a .md file instead of an .html file I changed the output to github_document

The hw01_gapminder.md file can be found [here](hw01_gapminder.md)

I found that at times the syntax can be tempermental. For example, when trying add headers to an .Rmd file, some headers required a buffer line above and below, but some did not. Otherwise, as always, I found referencing online forums such as StackOverflow very helpful.
