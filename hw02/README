## hw02 Process ##

1. I created a repository on github
2. I started a new project in RStudio and used the web URL to Connect RStudio to git and GitHub
3. I then created a new .Rmd file locally called "hw02"
4. I worked through hw02 in the hw02.Rmd file
5. I then used the pull, edit locally, save, commit, push to github.com workflow
6. Finally, I added process and reflection sections to the README.md file locally and committed them to github.com

I actually had an easier time with this homework assignment than the first homework assignment. I feel more comfortable with github and Rstudio. I also found that with my background in GIS, queries and query logic are fairly straightforward.

I did get an error temporarily when trying to knit my hw02.Rmd file. The problem stemed from including install.packages() in addition to library(). I used a CS forum online to resolve the issue.
