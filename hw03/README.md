I tackled the following tasks:

* Get the maximum and minimum of GDP per capita for all continents.
* How is life expectancy changing over time on different continents?
* Report the absolute and/or relative abundance of countries with low life expectancy over time by continent

I found that the third task was the most challenging. I had trouble computing the number of countries below the mean life expectancy rate for each year by continent. I found it easy to compute the number of countries below the mean life expectancy rate for each year, but I couldn't break it down by continent. To remedy this problem I used count(benchmark, year) instead of just count(benchmark).
