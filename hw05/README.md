# Process

I found this assignment relatively straight forward. Factor management, File I/O, and writing figures to files went smoothely, so I spent more time on vizualization design.

One of the most intriguing aspects of the singer_locations dataset was the latitude and longitude variables associated with each artist. As a geography student here at UBC, I really wanted to explore Rstudio's ability to create maps and vizualize spatial data. I spent most of my time experimenting with ggmap, which allows a user to plot maps. Using ggmaps and ggplot2 in concert allowed me to look at the spatial distributions of artists on a world map and artist density in the USA. These maps gave me ample opportunity to vizualize the singer_location data. I used stack overflow and R documentation extensively to fascilitate my introduction to ggmap.
