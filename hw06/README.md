# Process

For this homework assignment I tackled the following tasks
* Writing functions
* Work with candy data
* Work with singer data

I found that writing functions was fairly easy when using dplyr verbs, but became harder when I tried to create my easylm() function. It took my awhile to realize that I needed to convert the arguements (variables) into vectors before I could plot the variables.

Handling the candy data was tedious. I ended up cleaning the data in excel because I was crunched for time. My analysis of the data turned out to be straight forward but I struggled temporarly with the categorical responses contained within the dataset.

I really enjoyed playing around with ggmap and other mapping functions. I ended up creating my own functions that allow users to determine the year and the amount of data to be mapped.

As always, I relied heavily on various stackoverflow forums for help when I was stuck.
