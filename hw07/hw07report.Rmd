# Download the data

*To download the data I created a function -- download_data() -- that can download data from a url. Please refer to the [exploratory.R](https://github.com/peterwhitman/STAT545-whitman-peter/blob/master/hw07/R/exploratory.R) script in the R folder for the function.*

# Exploratory Analysis

*To read the data, I created a second function -- read() -- whichs reads the downloaded .csv file into a dataframe.*

*Below, I've created some descriptive plots. You can view the source files for plot. 1 [here](https://github.com/peterwhitman/STAT545-whitman-peter/blob/master/hw07/figures/LifeExp_BoxPlot.png) and plot. 2 [here](https://github.com/peterwhitman/STAT545-whitman-peter/blob/master/hw07/figures/LifeExp_OverTime.png).*


![](figures/LifeExp_BoxPlot.png)

*plot 1. life expectancy for each continent, with outliers in pink*

![](figures/LifeExp_OverTime.png)

*plot. 2 the changes in life expectancy over time by continent*

*The reordered gapminder data can be found [here](https://github.com/peterwhitman/STAT545-whitman-peter/blob/master/hw07/data/ReorderContinents_MeanLifeExp.csv). The function that I used to read, plot, and reorder the data can be found in the [exploratory.R](https://github.com/peterwhitman/STAT545-whitman-peter/blob/master/hw07/R/figures.R) script.*

# Statistical Analysis

*I fit a linear regression of life expectancy on year within each country. The function that I used to complete this task can be found in the [statistical.R](https://github.com/peterwhitman/STAT545-whitman-peter/blob/master/hw07/R/statistical.R) script and the source file for this table can be found [here](https://github.com/peterwhitman/STAT545-whitman-peter/blob/master/hw07/data/Table_lm.csv). The below table is the ouput of this function.*

```{r}
Table_lm <- read.csv("data/Table_lm.csv")
kable(Table_lm)
```

*I found the countries within each continent with the highest and lowest intercepts. The function that I used to create this table can be found in the [statistical.R](https://github.com/peterwhitman/STAT545-whitman-peter/blob/master/hw07/R/statistical.R) script and the source file for this table can be found [here](https://github.com/peterwhitman/STAT545-whitman-peter/blob/master/hw07/data/Table_lm.csv)*

```{r}
TopBottom_lm <- read.csv("data/TopBottom_lm.csv")
kable(TopBottom_lm)
```

# Generate Figures

*I created .pdf doucment with scatterplots of life expectancy vs. year, faceting on country, and fitted line overlaid. This is a large document, so I have not embedded it here. Please click [here](https://github.com/peterwhitman/STAT545-whitman-peter/blob/master/hw07/figures/Plot_lm.pdf) to see the document. Please navigate to the [figures.R](https://github.com/peterwhitman/STAT545-whitman-peter/blob/master/hw07/R/figures.R) script to see the function that I wrote to complete this task.*

# Automate the pipeline

*This entire assignment was automated using remake instead of make. The YAML file, which was used to automate my pipeline can be found [here](https://github.com/peterwhitman/STAT545-whitman-peter/blob/master/hw07/remake.yml)*
