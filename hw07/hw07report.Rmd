# Download the data

*To download the data I created a function -- download_data() -- that can download data from a url. Please refer to the [exploratory.R]() script in the R folder for the function.*

# Exploratory Analysis

*To read the data, I created a second function -- read() -- whichs reads the downloaded .csv file into a dataframe.*

*Below, I've created some descriptive plots. You can view the source files for the boxplot [here]() and the change over time plot [here]().*


![A boxplot of life expectancy for each continent, with outliers in pink.](figures/LifeExp_BoxPlot.png)


![A plot of the changes in life expectancy over time by continent](figures/LifeExp_OverTime.png)

*The reordered gapminder data can be found [here](). The function that I used to read, plot, and reorder the data can be found in the [exploratory.R]() script.*

# Statistical Analysis

*I fit a linear regression of life expectancy on year within each country. The function that I used to complete this task can be found in the [statistical.R]() script and the source file for this table can be found (here)[]. The below table is the ouput of this function.*

```{r}
Table_lm <- read.csv("data/Table_lm.csv")
kable(Table_lm)
```

*I found the countries within each continent with the highest and lowest intercepts. The function that I used to create this table can be found in the [statistical.R]() script and the source file for this table can be found [here]()

```{r}
TopBottom_lm <- read.csv("data/TopBottom_lm.csv")
kable(TopBottom_lm)
```
