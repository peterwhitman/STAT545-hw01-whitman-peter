I was hell bent on creating a shiny app with interactive choropleth maps. In hindsight this was probably overly ambitious. Nevertheless, I succeeded  in creating an interactive app that allows a user to input a variable to be mapped. One of the cool features of the map is that it allows the user to click on a country for more detailed information. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to figure out how to make the map react to changes in the inputed year. However, I was able to create tabs for a plot and a table that do react to changes in the inputed year. I didn’t spend much time making my app aesthetically pleasing, so that is definitely something to be improved. As always I relied heavily on R documentation and stack overflow for help/inspiration.
