Package creation in the R environment turned out to be fairly straight forward. I didn't have much time this week to devote to this assignment, so none of my functions are all that impressive. So, once I have more time I'd like to use this package as a template for further, more advanced package development. I primarily used the package that we created in class a reference material.
