# Process

With all of the hustle and bustle associated with the end of the year, I wasn't able to devote that much time to this assignment, so I purposefully chose a more modest prompt. For this homework assignment, I chose to use the geonames and gapminder packages to display graphs of population density over time by country, faceted by continent. I've really enjoyed interacting with APIs and the web through R. This assignment has provided inspiration for future projects.
